Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.

Why use Unsupervised Learning?
Below are some main reasons which describe the importance of Unsupervised Learning:

Unsupervised learning is helpful for finding useful insights from the data.
Unsupervised learning is much similar as a human learns to think by their own experiences, which makes it closer to the real AI.
Unsupervised learning works on unlabeled and uncategorized data which make unsupervised learning more important.
In real-world, we do not always have input data with the corresponding output so to solve such cases, we need unsupervised learning.


Clustering: Clustering is a method of grouping the objects into clusters such that objects with most similarities remains into a group and has less or no similarities with the objects of another group. Cluster analysis finds the commonalities between the data objects and categorizes them as per the presence and absence of those commonalities.
